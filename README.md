**mdobeLens** is a web application designed to assist microstock contributors, like myself, in analyzing Adobe Stock search results and researching trends on the platform. As a fellow microstock contributor, I understand the need for a powerful tool to efficiently navigate the stock photography industry. By utilizing the public **Adobe Stock API**, mdobeLens offers a clean and uncluttered view of search results, along with filters available with the API, but not found on Adobe Stock itself. This application empowers contributors to make informed decisions and capitalize on emerging trends, providing a valuable resource for enhancing productivity and success in the microstock market.
